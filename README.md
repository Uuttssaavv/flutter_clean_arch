### Project Description

#### Data
The data layer is the outermost layer of the application and is responsible for communicating with the server-side or a local database and data management logic. It also contains repository implementations.

##### 1. Data Source

Describes the process of acquiring and updating the data.
Consist of remote and local Data Sources. Remote Data Source will perform HTTP requests on the API. At the same time, local Data sources will cache or persist data.
##### 2. Models

An entity will depend on the data acquired from the different data sources.
Serialization of JSON structure into Dart maps Entity objects to Models and vice-versa.
##### 3. Repository

The bridge between the Data layer and the Domain layer.
Actual implementations of the repositories in the Domain layer. Repositories are responsible for coordinating data from the different Data Sources.


#### Domain
The domain layer is responsible for all the business logic. It is written purely in Dart without flutter elements because the domain should only be concerned with the business logic of the application, not with the implementation details.

##### a. Use Cases

Describes the logic processing required for the application.
Communicates directly with the repositories.
##### b. Repositories

Abstract classes that define the expected functionality of outer layers.
##### c. Entities

Business objects of the application.
An entity will not depend on the data acquired from the server side.


#### Presentation
The presentation layer is the most framework-dependent layer. It is responsible for all the UI and handling the events in the UI. It does not contain any business logic.

##### a. Widget (Screens/Views)

Widgets notify the events and listen to the states emitted from the Bloc.
##### b. BloC

Receive the events from the views and interact with use cases accordingly.
Emit the state according to the data received from the use cases.
Bloc does not know about the view at all. It communicates in the form of states and events only.
